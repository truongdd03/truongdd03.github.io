The project involved developing a <strong class=\"text-primary\">website</strong> that serves as a comprehensive directory for farmers' markets across the United States. This platform is designed to help small business owners/state associations promote their markets while also providing consumers with an easy way to discover and learn about local markets in their area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I built a completely new website from the ground up using <strong class=\"text-primary\">Vue</strong>, <strong class=\"text-primary\">TypeScript</strong>, <strong class=\"text-primary\">MySQL</strong>, and <strong class=\"text-primary\">PHP</strong>. Some of the standout features include:\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"text-primary\">Real-time notifications</strong>: USDA admins receive instant alerts to approve or reject publishing requests.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"text-primary\">Collaborative spreadsheet</strong>: An Excel-like interface allows members of the same association to work together in real-time to add new farmers' markets to the site.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"text-primary\">Excel parser</strong>: Easily converts farmers' market data from Excel/CSV files into the database.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"text-primary\">Customizable web pages</strong>: Each state association can personalize their pages, adjusting colors, text, and images before publishing their markets. For example, <a  class=\"text-primary\" href=\"https://www.usdalocalfooddirectories.com/bulkupdate/org/ohio\">Ohio State Extension</a> has its own tailored page.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"text-primary\">Interactive map and search engine</strong>: Users can filter markets based on various criteria.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"text-primary\">User behavior tracker</strong>: Monitors site performance by tracking visitor activity&mdash;who's visiting, how often, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The website is live and actively used by three state associations to regularly update their local farmers' markets. It&rsquo;s in the process of being rolled out to other states, and I&rsquo;m excited to see more markets appear on the platform soon!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex max-w-full flex-col flex-grow\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] text-message flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5 overflow-x-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"ba93729e-2ca4-4100-a039-9338a5c13e75\">\n<div class=\"flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[3px]\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>This was my first experience tackling a project of this scale from the ground up, guiding it through every stage&mdash;from <strong class=\"text-primary\">development and testing</strong> to <strong class=\"text-primary\">deployment</strong>.

While large amounts of data can be valuable, it often becomes overwhelming, leaving users struggling to extract meaningful insights. That&rsquo;s where our team steps in. We&rsquo;ve developed powerful tools that enable users to create custom calculations and metrics, transforming their raw data into actionable insights. We offer a Visual Builder with an intuitive user interface for non-technical users and a robust SQL language for those with technical expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"20c751c5-9cc9-49a2-ace0-0809cbdfb012\">\n<p><strong>About my intern project:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to structured data, our customers also store <strong class=\"text-primary\">unstructured data</strong>&mdash;such as text files and call transcripts&mdash;in Data Cloud.

I integrated <strong class=\"text-primary\">vector embeddings</strong> into our custom SQL language, enabling users to perform <strong class=\"text-primary\">similarity searches</strong> within unstructured data. For example, users can now easily identify all reviews that mention a specific issue. Previously, this was nearly impossible, but with vector embeddings, we can now convert reviews into vectors and measure their similarity to a target vector, making this process efficient and effective.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"78aa6069-e797-4c42-bf0d-30335b780f9b\">\n<p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I introduced new syntax to our custom SQL language by implementing CROSS JOIN and ARRAY_AGG functions using <strong class=\"text-primary\">Java</strong>.

Additionally, I introduced a <strong class=\"text-primary\">file tree feature</strong>, enabling users to work on multiple files simultaneously. The code is saved locally on the user's device and can be easily shared with others via a simple URL.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong class=\"text-primary\">VSCode extension</strong> was developed during an internal hackathon to address an existing challenge: users struggled to locate relevant documentation while working on various parts of the codebase. To solve this, we designed a solution that integrates our codebase with <strong class=\"text-primary\">Notion</strong> and <strong class=\"text-primary\">Slack</strong>, where our documentation is stored, using a <strong class=\"text-primary\">tag-based system</strong>. Each piece of code is assigned a tag that links directly to the corresponding documentation.
