        "description": "<p><strong>About my team:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I joined the <strong class=\"text-primary\">Calculated Insights</strong> team at the Bellevue office, where our mission is to help customers unlock the true potential of their data stored in Data Cloud. While large amounts of data can be valuable, it often becomes overwhelming, leaving users struggling to extract meaningful insights. That&rsquo;s where our team steps in. We&rsquo;ve developed powerful tools that enable users to create custom calculations and metrics, transforming their raw data into actionable insights. We offer a Visual Builder with an intuitive user interface for non-technical users and a robust SQL language for those with technical expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"20c751c5-9cc9-49a2-ace0-0809cbdfb012\">\n<p><strong>About my intern project:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to structured data, our customers also store <strong class=\"text-primary\">unstructured data</strong>&mdash;such as text files and call transcripts&mdash;in Data Cloud. We wanted to empower users to derive valuable insights from this unstructured data as well. That&rsquo;s where my intern project came in. I integrated <strong class=\"text-primary\">vector embeddings</strong> into our custom SQL language, enabling users to perform <strong class=\"text-primary\">similarity searches</strong> within unstructured data. For example, users can now easily identify all reviews that mention a specific issue. Previously, this was nearly impossible, but with vector embeddings, we can now convert reviews into vectors and measure their similarity to a target vector, making this process efficient and effective.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"78aa6069-e797-4c42-bf0d-30335b780f9b\">\n<p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I introduced new syntax to our custom SQL language by implementing CROSS JOIN and ARRAY_AGG functions using <strong class=\"text-primary\">Java</strong>. Additionally, I developed a design document that outlined how to boost the performance of our integration by 50%, leveraging <strong class=\"text-primary\">FAISS</strong>&mdash;a library by Meta optimized for efficient vector distance calculations.</li>\n<li>Toward the end of my internship, I had some extra time, so I assisted my team with enhancements to the IN operator and completed several smaller tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had a great time diving into vector embeddings and understanding how similarity search operates. In addition, I gained valuable knowledge about <strong class=\"text-primary\">Apache Spark</strong> and <strong class=\"text-primary\">AWS</strong>, as our SQL interpreter is powered by <strong class=\"text-primary\">Spark SQL</strong> running on <strong class=\"text-primary\">EKS</strong>. I also deepened my understanding of <strong class=\"text-primary\">parsers</strong> and <strong class=\"text-primary\">abstract syntax trees (AST)</strong> since much of my work involved them. Along the way, I had the opportunity to connect with many talented individuals, which made the experience even more rewarding.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>",

Previously, developers and QA engineers had to manually initiate each task, a time-consuming and complex process, especially for those unfamiliar with it. The goal was to create a <strong class=\"text-primary\">web page</strong> with a user-friendly interface that allows our service to be activated with a single click.

The most challenging aspect was automating the process by determining which APIs to call for enabling the service, retrieving necessary logs, and obtaining service status updates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After completing the QA page, I utilized my spare time to collaborate with the scrum team on bug fixes and feature enhancements. Notable tasks included updating the default language of the workspace from a hardcoded value to the organization's language, which improved accessibility and helped clean up the codebase.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This was my first internship at a large company, and it provided invaluable insights into software development processes and agile methodology. I joined the team just as we were preparing for our first product rollout, which gave me hands-on experience with large-scale projects. I also significantly enhanced my skills in code tracing and debugging, which proved crucial in navigating the challenges of complex systems.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>",
